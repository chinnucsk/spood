spood is a spoofing DNS proxy with a vaguely obscene name. All in Erlang.


WHAT IS IT

spood is a DNS proxy that listens for requests on localhost and proxies
the requests by spoofing the packets from the IP addresses of other
clients. spood might be useful if you're using a DNS tunnel like sods:

REQUIREMENTS

* procket: http://github.com/msantos/procket
* epcap: http://github.com/msantos/epcap


SETUP

1. Adjust src/spood.erl:

Change the IP addresses/MAC addresses to your network.

2. Build it and run:

mkdir deps
cd deps
ln -s /path/to/procket .
ln -s /path/to/epcap .
make
./start.sh


TODO

* add a ping function to spood
    * call ICMP ping for {192,168,213,1}, 24
    * add each host that responds to a list
    * call list strategy

* add ability to get mac addresses programmatically

* allow user to specify name server address

* support multiple name servers

* add ability to turn on/off debug output

* add sanity checks on sniffed DNS packets, like checking domain

* convert packet manufacturing to use epcap_net
