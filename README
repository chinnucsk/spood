spood is a spoofing DNS proxy with a vaguely obscene name. All in Erlang.


WHAT IS IT

spood is a DNS proxy that listens for requests on localhost and proxies
the requests by spoofing the packets from the IP addresses of other
clients. spood might be useful if you're using a DNS tunnel like sods:

REQUIREMENTS

* procket: http://github.com/msantos/procket
* epcap: http://github.com/msantos/epcap


SETUP

1. Adjust src/spood.erl:

Change the IP addresses/MAC addresses to your network.

2. Build it and run:

mkdir deps
cd deps
ln -s /path/to/procket .
ln -s /path/to/epcap .
make
./start.sh

3. Test it:

$ nslookup
> server 127.0.0.1
Default server: 127.0.0.1
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
> www.google.com
Server:         127.0.0.1
Address:        127.0.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
www.google.com  canonical name = www.l.google.com.
Name:   www.l.google.com
Address: 173.194.33.104


TODO

* add a ping function to spood
    * call ICMP ping for {192,168,213,1}, 24
    * add each host that responds to a list
    * call list strategy

* add ability to get mac addresses programmatically

* allow user to specify name server address

* support multiple name servers

* add ability to turn on/off debug output

* add sanity checks on sniffed DNS packets, like checking domain

* convert packet manufacturing to use epcap_net
